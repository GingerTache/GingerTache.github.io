<h1>The Nomen Republic</h1>
<p>The Nomen Republic are the original and oldest governing body in the sector. They grew out of the first settled world in Arcanum Tek, and began colonizing the sector. They still operate and assume control as the sole government, though they are not able to exert their power outside a few neighboring systems and have all but given up attempting to expand their influence through force but instead operate several "embasies" on nearby worlds (though these are mostly just token efforts). </p>
